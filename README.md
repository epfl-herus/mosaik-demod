The new load simulator integrated to mosaik is in simulator_mosaik.py

demo_newload.py show usage example

To run the load simulator, you need to specify the path of the Activity-based-demand-modelling folder.
this can be done at the beggining of the file simulator_mosaik.py.
The Activity-based-demand-modelling folder can be downloaded from github https://github.com/lionel42/Activity-based-demand-modelling/tree/dev (send me an email to get access)
